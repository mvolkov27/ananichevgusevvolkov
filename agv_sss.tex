\begin{abstract}
We present several infinite series of \sa\ for which
the minimum length of reset words is close to the
square of the number of states. These automata are
closely related to primitive  matrices with large exponent.

\section{Background and overview}
\label{intro}

A \emph{complete deterministic finite automaton} (DFA) is a triple
$\mathrsfs{A}=\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta\rangle$, where $Q$ and
$\Sigma$ are finite sets called the \emph{state set} and the
\emph{input alphabet} respectively, and $\delta:Q\times\Sigma\to
Q$ is a totally defined function called the \emph{transition
function}. Let $\Sigma^*$ stand for the collection of all finite
words over the alphabet $\Sigma$, including the empty word.
The function $\delta$ extends to a function $Q\times\Sigma^*\to Q$
(still denoted by $\delta$) in the following natural way: for every
$q\in Q$ and $w\in\Sigma^*$, we set
$$\delta(q,w)=\begin{cases}
q &\text{ if $w$ is empty},\\
\delta(\delta(q,v),a) &\text{ if $w=va$ for some $v\in\Sigma^*$ and $a\in\Sigma$}.
\end{cases}$$
Thus, via $\delta$, every word $w\in\Sigma^*$ acts on the set $Q$.

A DFA $\mathrsfs{A}=\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta\rangle$ is called
\emph{synchronizing} if the action of some word $w\in\Sigma^*$
resets $\mathrsfs{A}$, that is, leaves the automaton in one
particular state no matter at which state in $Q$ it is applied:
$\delta(q,w)=\delta(q',w)$ for all $q,q'\in Q$. Any such word $w$
is said to be a \emph{reset word} for the DFA.

Synchronizing automata serve as transparent and natural models of
error-resistant systems in many applications (coding theory, robotics,
testing of reactive systems) and also reveal interesting connections
with symbolic dynamics and other parts of mathematics. For a brief
introduction to the theory of \sa\ we refer the reader to the recent
surveys~\cite{Sa05,Vo08}. Here we focus on the so-called \v{C}ern\'{y}
conjecture that constitutes a major open problem in this area.

In~1964 \v{C}ern\'{y}~\cite{Ce64} constructed for each $n>1$ a \san\
$\mathrsfs{C}_n$ with $n$ states whose shortest reset word has length
$(n-1)^2$. Soon after that he conjectured that these automata
represent the worst possible case, that is, every \san\ with $n$ states
can be reset by a word of length $(n-1)^2$. This imply looking conjecture
resists researchers' efforts for more than 40 years. Even though the
conjecture has been confirmed for various restricted classes of \sa\
(cf., e.g., \cite{Ep90,Du98,Ka03,Tr07,AS09,Vo09}), no upper bound of magnitude
$O(n^2)$ for the minimum length of reset words for $n$-state \sa\ is known
in general---the best upper bound achieved so far is $\frac{n^3-n}6$,
see~\cite{Pi83}.

One of the difficulties that one encounters when approaching the
\v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture is that there are only very few examples
of \emph{extreme} \sa, that is, $n$-state \sa\ whose shortest reset
words have length $(n-1)^2$. In fact, the \v{C}ern\'{y} series
$\mathrsfs{C}_n$, $n=2,3,\dotsc$, is the only known infinite series
of extreme \sa. Besides that, we know only a few isolated examples
of such automata, see~\cite{Vo08} for a complete list. Moreover,
even \emph{slowly} \sa, that is, \sa\ whose shortest reset words have
length close to the \v{C}ern\'{y} bound are very rare. This empirical
observation is supported also by probabilistic arguments. For instance,
Higgins~\cite{Hi88} has shown that the probability that a composition of $2n$
random self-maps of a set of size $n$ is a constant map tends to~1 as $n$
goes to infinity. In terms of automata, Higgins's result means that
a random automaton with $n$ states and at least $2n$ input letters
has a reset word of length $2n$. For further results of the same flavor
see~\cite{SZ}. Thus, there is no hope to find new examples of slowly
\sa\ by a chance or via a random sampling experiment.

We therefore have designed and performed a set of exhaustive search
experiments. Our experiments are briefly described in Section~\ref{experiments}
while the main body of the paper is devoted to a theoretical analysis
of their outcome. We concentrate on two principal issues. In Section~\ref{matrices}
we discuss a similarity between the distribution of lengths of shortest
reset words for \sa\ and the distribution of exponents of primitive digraphs.
Section~\ref{sss} collects several new series of slowly \sa. The ``initial''
examples in the series were found in the course of the experiments; then
each example was expanded to a series of automata that have been proved
to be slowly synchronizing. In our opinion, the proof technique is also
of interest; in fact, we provide a transparent and uniform approach to all
sufficiently large slowly \sa\ with 2~input letters, both new and already
known ones.

\section{Preliminaries on digraphs and their exponents}
\label{preliminaries}

A \emph{directed graph} (digraph) is a pair $D=\langle V,E\rangle$ where $V$ is
a finite set and $E\subseteq V\times V$. We refer to elements of $V$ and $E$ as
\emph{vertices} and \emph{edges}. Observe that our definition allows loops but
excludes multiple edges. If $v,v'\in V$ and $e=(v,v')\in E$, the edge $e$ is said
to be \emph{outgoing} for $v$. We assume the reader's acquaintance with basic
notions of the theory of directed graphs such as (directed) path, cycle,
isomorphism etc.

Given a DFA $\mathrsfs{A}=\langle Q,\Sigma,\delta\rangle$, its \emph{underlying
digraph} $D(\mathrsfs{A})$ has $Q$ as the vertex set and $(q,q')\in Q\times Q$ is
an edge of $D(\mathrsfs{A})$ if and only if $q'=\delta(q,a)$ for some $a\in\Sigma$.
It is easy to see that a digraph $D$ is isomorphic to the underlying digraph of some
DFA if and only if each vertex of $D$ has at least one outgoing edge. In the sequel,
we always consider only digraphs satisfying this property. Every DFA $\mathrsfs{A}$
such that $D\cong D(\mathrsfs{A})$ is called a \emph{coloring} of $D$. Thus, every
coloring of $D$ is defined by assigning non-empty sets of labels (colors) from some
alphabet $\Sigma$ to edges of $D$ such that the label sets assigned to the outgoing
edges of each vertex form a partition of $\Sigma$. Fig.\,\ref{fig:cerny} shows a
digraph and two of its colorings by $\Sigma=\{a,b\}$.

Given a digraph $D=\langle V,E\rangle$, its matrix $M(D)$ is just
the incidence matrix of the edge relation, that is, a $V\times V$-matrix
whose entry in the row $v$ and the column $v'$ is 1 if $(v,v')\in E$ and
0 otherwise. For instance, the matrix of the digraph in Fig.~1 (with respect
to the chosen numbering of its vertices) is $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1&1&0&0\\
0&1&1&0\\ 0&0&1&1\\ 1&0&0&0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$. Conversely, given
an $n\times n$-matrix $P=(p_{ij})$ with non-negative real entries, we assign
to it a digraph $D(P)$ on the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ as follows: $(i,j)$ is an
edge of $D(P)$ if and only if $p_{ij}>0$. This ``two-way'' correspondence
allows us to formulate in terms of digraphs several important for the sequel
notions and results which originated in the classical Perron--Frobenius theory
of non-negative matrices.

Recall that a digraph $D=\langle V,E\rangle$ is said to be \emph{strongly
connected} if for every pair $(v,v')\in V\times V$, there exists a path
from $v$ to $v'$. When studying the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture, we may
restrict ourselves to automata whose underlying digraphs are strongly
connected because the validity of the conjecture can be easily reduced
to this case (see \cite{Pi78} for example). By the $t^{th}$ \emph{power}
of $D$ we mean the digraph $D^t$ with the same vertex set $V$, such that
$(v,v')\in V\times V$ is an edge of $D^t$ if and only if there is a path
in $D$ from $v$ to $v'$ of length precisely $t$. A strongly connected digraph
$D$ is called \emph{primitive} if the greatest common divisor of the lengths
of all cycles in $D$ is equal to~1. (In the literature such graphs are sometimes
called \emph{aperiodic}.)

The following elementary result is well known:
\begin{lemma}[{\mdseries\cite[Theorem 1.0.1]{RaAl05}}]
\label{schur}
If $a_1,\dots,a_n$ are positive integer whose greatest common divisor is equal
to~$1$, then there exists an integer $N$ such that every integer larger than $N$
is expressible as a non-negative integer combination of $a_1,\dots,a_n$.
\end{lemma}
Lemma~\ref{schur} readily implies that if $D$ is a primitive digraph, then some
power $D^t$ of $D$ has an edge between any pair of vertices, i.e., is a complete
digraph with loops. The least $t$ with this property is called the \emph{exponent}
of the digraph $D$ and is denoted by $\gamma(D)$. We need some results on exponents
of digraphs summarized as follows.

\begin{theorem}
\label{dulmage}
\emph{(a) (\cite{Wi50,DM62}, \cite[Theorem~1]{DM64})} If a primitive graph $D$
has $n$~vertices, then  $\gamma(D)\le(n-1)^2+1$.

\emph{(b) \cite[Theorem~6 and Corollary 4]{DM64}} Up to isomorphism, there is
exactly one primitive graph $D$ on $n$ vertices for which $\gamma(D)=(n-1)^2+1$,
and exactly one for which $\gamma(D)=(n-1)^2$. The matrices of these digraphs
are
\begin{equation}
\label{wielandt}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0\\

0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1\\

1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\text{ respectively.}
\end{equation}

\emph{(c) \cite[Theorem~7]{DM64}} If $n>4$ is even, then there is no
primitive digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices such that
\begin{equation}
\label{even gap}
n^2-4n+6<\gamma(D)<(n-1)^2,
\end{equation}
and, up to isomorphism, there are exactly $3$ or exactly $4$ primitive
digraphs $D$ on $n$ vertices with $\gamma(D)=n^2-4n+6$, according
as $n$ is or is not a~multiple of $3$.

\emph{(d) \cite[Theorem~8]{DM64}} If $n>3$ is odd, then there is no
primitive digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices such that
\begin{equation}
\label{first odd gap}
n^2-3n+4<\gamma(D)<(n-1)^2,
\end{equation}
and, up to isomorphism, there is exactly one primitive graph $D$ on $n$ vertices
for which $\gamma(D)=n^2-3n+4$, exactly one for which $\gamma(D)=n^2-3n+3$, and
exactly two for which $\gamma(D)=n^2-3n+2$. The matrices of these digraphs
are:
\begin{equation}

\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & 0\\

\end{equation}

\emph{(e) \cite[Theorem~8]{DM64}} If $n>3$ is odd, then there is no
primitive digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices such that
\begin{equation}
\label{second odd gap}
n^2-4n+6<\gamma(D)<n^2-3n+2,
\end{equation}
and, up to isomorphism, there are exactly $3$ or exactly $4$ primitive digraphs $D$
on $n$ vertices with $\gamma(D)=n^2-4n+6$, according as $n$ is or is not

\end{theorem}

\section{Exponents of digraphs vs lengths of reset words}
\label{matrices}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{intro}, this paper has grown
from certain observations made when we analyzed experimental
results. One such observation has been a similarity between
the ``upper parts'' of two sequences: the sequence of possible
lengths of shortest reset words for 2-letter \sa\ with $n$ states
and the sequence of possible exponents of primitive digraphs with
$n$ vertices. As it is clear from Theorem~\ref{dulmage}, the
upper part of the latter sequence has certain gaps whose sizes
and positions depend on the parity of $n$; our experiments have
revealed quite a similar pattern of gaps in the upper part
of the former sequence. Table~\ref{9 states} illustrates this
observation for $n=9$.

\begin{table}[ht]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The data in the second row of Table~\ref{9 states} are calculated
from Theorem~\ref{dulmage}, while the data in the third row come from
our experiments.

Concerning gaps in the upper part of the sequence of possible lengths of shortest
reset words for 2-letter \sa\ with $n$ states, we notice that the first gap has been
registered in earlier experiments in the area, see~\cite{Tr06,Tr06a}. (Namely, according
to~\cite{Tr06,Tr06a} for $n=7,8,9,10$ there exists no 2-letter \sa\ with $n$ states
whose shortest reset words have lengths between $n^2-2n$ and $n^2-3n+5$.) However,
to the best of our knowledge, the second gap as seen in Table~\ref{9 states} has not
been reported in the literature up to now.

We strongly believe that the observed similarity is more than a coincidence.
Clearly, there are deep connections between primitive digraphs and \sa. Indeed,
it is well known (see~\cite{AGW}) that if the underlying digraph of a \san\
is strongly connected that the digraph must be primitive; on the other hand,
as follows from Trahtman's proof~\cite{Tr09} of the so-called Road Coloring
conjecture by Adler, Goodwyn, and Weiss~\cite{AGW}, every primitive digraph
admits a synchronizing coloring. This, however, does not suffice to explain
similarities such as in Table~\ref{9 states} because many of slowly \sa\
``responsible'' for non-zero entries in the third row cannot be obtained
as colorings of digraphs with large exponents corresponding to non-zero
entries in the second row. In the next section we demonstrate some
new connections between primitive digraphs with large exponents and
slowly \sa\ with two input letters. In this way, we derive all known
series of such automata and construct many new other ones.



\section{Main results and slowly sinchronizing series}
\label{sss}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:anan}
For each $n$, there exists strongly connected \san\ with $n$ states,
such that it's shortest reset word is of length $n^2-3n+3$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:anan}
The word $(ab^{n - 2})^{n - 2}a$ is a reset word for the automaton $\mathrsfs{B}_n$.
\end{lemma}

\end{center}
\caption{The automaton $\mathrsfs{B}_5$}\label{fig:anan}
\end{figure}

The states of the automaton $\mathrsfs{B}_n$
are the residues modulo $n$ and its input letters $a$ and $b$ act
as follows:
$$
 \delta(m,a)=
 \begin{cases}
  m + 2\!\!\pmod{n} & \text{for $m = 0$}, \\
  m+1\!\!\pmod{n} & \text{for $m \neq 0$};
  \end{cases}
\qquad \delta(m,b)=m+1\!\!\pmod{n}.
$$
The smallest automaton in the series is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:anan}.

\begin{proof}
Let $w$ be \ssw . It is clear that action of $w$ leaves automaton $\mathrsfs{B}_n$ in state 2.
For any $u \in \Sigma^*$ word $uw$ is synchronizing too and it also brings automaton to the state 2.
In other words, there is a path in underlying
digraph from any vertex to vertex 2 of length $p$, if $p \geq |w|$.
Let us consider paths from 2 to 2. Every one of them is the combination of cycles of length $n$ and $n - 1$.
Thus for any $p \geq |w|$ the following is true: $p = xn + y(n - 1)$, where $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers.
It is well known(See smth) that $n(n - 1) - n - (n - 1) = n^2 - 3n + 1$ is the greatest number that could not be represented
as a nonegative integer combination of $n$ and $n - 1$. Thus $|w| \geq n^2 - 3n + 2$.
Suppose that $|w| = n^2 - 3n + 2$.
%and  then there is a path of such length from state $1$ to state $2$.
If we read this word from state $1$ then we get a path of length $n^2 - 3n + 1$ from $2$ to $2$ which is not possible due to previous
statement. Thus $|w| \geq n^2 - 3n + 3$ but this bound is tight by lemma~\ref{lemma:anan}.
\end{proof}

The states of the automaton $\mathrsfs{C}_n$
are the residues modulo $n$ and its input letters $a$ and $b$ act
as follows:
$$
 \delta(m,a)=
 \begin{cases}
  m + 1 \!\!\pmod{n} & \text{for $m = 0$}, \\
  m \!\!\pmod{n} & \text{for $m \neq 0$};
  \end{cases}
\qquad \delta(m,b)=m+1\!\!\pmod{n}.
$$
The smallest automaton in the series is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cherny}.

\begin{proof}
Let $w$ be \ssw\ of $\mathrsfs{C}_n$. Action of $b$ is cyclic permutation thus $w$ ends on $a$. Let $w = w'a$.
It is easy to see that action of $a$ and $a^2$ are equal thus every occurence of $a$ in $w$ is
followed by $b$ except the last one. Let's introduce new letter(and transition) $d = ab$ then $w'$ could be
transformed into $v \in \{b,d\}^*$.

\end{proof}

\section{Experiments}
\label{experiments}
During the experiments every initially-connected deterministic automata was checked on synchronizability and it's shortest reset word was
calculated. This class of automata was deceided to use because it contains every strongly connected automata and has very simple and convenient 
way of enumeration which is presented and thoroughly described in [Almeida]. There are about 700 billions of initially-connected deterministic automata
with 9 states and it is hard task for a single computer to do. That's why this check was distributed and done within a day on 60 cores of 
amd opteron 2.6 Ghz processors. Program was written in C with mpi. Every obtained slowly synchronizing automaton was rechecked 
with package TESTAS[trahtman's site]
developed by A.Trahtman. 
It is also worth to mention that experiments show that deterministic automata indeed tends to be synchronizible with short reset words. 
Almost $90\%$ of initially-connected deterministic automata with 9 states could be synchronized with word of length not greater than 9.
And as shows random sampling experiment this part becomes bigger with growth of number of states.
